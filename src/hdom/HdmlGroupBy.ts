/**
 * The `hdml-group-by` component is used within the context of an
 * `hdml-frame` to group data based on specific fields. It allows you
 * to aggregate data based on common values in one or more fields.
 * This component is useful for summarizing data and performing
 * operations on grouped subsets of the dataset.
 *
 * The `hdml-group-by` component must contain at least one
 * `hdml-field` element to specify the field(s) by which the data will
 * be grouped.
 *
 * Grouped data can then be further manipulated or analyzed within the
 * frameâ€™s scope.

 * event on the `document` element when component is connected to or
 * disconnected from the `document`.
