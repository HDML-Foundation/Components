/**
 * The `hdml-filter-by` component is used to filter data within the
 * context of an `hdml-frame`. It allows you to specify conditions to
 * filter rows of data based on specific criteria. This component is
 * essential for refining datasets and focusing on relevant
 * information.
 *
 * The `hdml-connective` element must be a child element of
 * `hdml-filter-by` and is used to specify the logical operator for
 * joining multiple filter conditions.
 *
 * Multiple `hdml-filter` elements can be included within
 * `hdml-connective` to define complex filter conditions.

 * event on the `document` element when component is connected to or
 * disconnected from the `document`.
